# What are these?

We have a couple of iOS example apps written to showcase SwiftCurrent in SwiftUI and UIKit apps.  These example apps have tests to show what testing could look like when you pull SwiftCurrent into your app.

# How do I run them?

To run these locally, clone our repo `git clone https://github.com/wwt/SwiftCurrent`, open `SwiftCurrent.xcworkspace`, run the `SwiftUIExample` scheme or the `UIKitExample` scheme to see these in action.  See the documentation in Xcode or [our website](https://wwt.github.io/SwiftCurrent/) to learn more about how this all works.

To learn more about interesting aspects of each app, click through to their README to see a breakdown of what they do and what you should look at.
